# Welcome to FRC 5160's Documentation!

This documentation is a resource for new and experienced members to 
learn important FRC information(particularly software-related).  

As of now, this documentation will primarily consist of software-related
docs; however, it is planned to extend this documentation to hardware-related
resources as well.
